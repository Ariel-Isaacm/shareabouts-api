Usage
-----

- First, make a clone of your production environment. It should mirror the
  number of servers available, as well as the memory available on those
  servers. Copy over the data from the database as well.

- Copy settings.py.template to settings.py and fill in the appropriate values.

- Download some usage logs (like, nginx access logs). These can be downloaded
  from Dotcloud from the command line with a call like:

    dc run -A shareaboutsapi www.0 cat /var/log/nginx/shareaboutsapi-default-www-0.access.log > access.log

  In the above command, replace 'shareaboutsapi' with your api server name,
  and '0' with the instance that you want to get the logs from.

- Run:

    cat access.log | ./extract_api_calls.py | ./construct_api_calls.py | python 25

- or, do them one at a time.

    cat access.log | ./extract_api_calls.py > api.log
    cat api.log | ./construct_api_calls.py > make_api_calls.py
    python make_api_calls.py 25

The 25 is the number of concurrent requests.
